* =org-roam-consult= -- An Unofficial Extension
This is a small collection of functions to operate [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] with the
help of [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] and its live preview feature.

Please note that this is WIP and developed for my personal use. Both
the functionality and the interface will change. If you do not want to
tinker with it, keep off your hands.

* Overview and usage
=org-roam-consult.el= provides several functions to connect org-roam
to consult's completing read interface. On the one hand, it provides
the following standalone functions which enhance =org-roam='s
capabilities:

- =org-roam-consult-rg-search= :: Search your roam-directory with grep
  or [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]]
- =org-roam-consult-backlinks= :: List backlinks to
  =org-roam-node-at-point= (e.g. currently open note) and sift through
  them with consult's completing-read and its live preview
- =org-roam-consult-file-find= :: Search your org-roam files with
  consult's completing-read and its live preview

On the other hand it overrides =org-roam-node-read= which is used by
=org-roam-node-find=, =org-roam-node-insert= and =org-roam-refile=. By
doing so, all functions utilizing completing-read resort to =consult=
for performing completion. Furthermore, the same is done for
=org-roam-ref-read= so that =consult= is used for completing
references as well.

* Installation

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-roam-consult
   :straight (:host github :repo "jgru/org-roam-consult")
   :init
   (require 'org-roam-consult)
   :custom
   (org-roam-consult-grep-func #'consult-ripgrep)
   :bind
   ("C-c n e" . org-roam-consult-file-find)
   ("C-c n b" . org-roam-consult-backlinks)
   ("C-c n r" . org-roam-consult-search))
#+end_src

* Dependencies
=org-roam-consult= is built on top of [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]] and [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]], it relies on its functionality.

Furthermore, ensure that you have [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] installed on your system, if
you set =org-roam-consult-grep-func= to =#'consult-ripgrep=.
